### By Tedham Anderson, Corey Finnigan and Juan Martinez

1. **Purpose of this Project:** This project looks at the average residential monthly energy bills, 
focusing on cost based on kWh consumption. We chose to look at this data based on its availability
from the City of Austin, and its longevity, given the fact that the data has been collected for
almost 20 years.

2. **Uses of this Project:** By using the app, consumers can query a range of dates and see the
average bill cost, the average fuel charge, the average kWh consumption within the City of Austin,
and get a graphical representation of the data. This information can be extremely useful *especially*
when considering the increasing trend of households determining to shift to a purely solar-powered
residential model.
