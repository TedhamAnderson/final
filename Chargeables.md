# Charging Users

###Free to the Consumer

We will allow consumers to view the original data and querried data for free. This will allow consumers to get an idea of what the data looks like and whether or not they'd be interested in paying for our services. We will also allow consumers to download the original data set because it's not reasonable to charge people for something that is already free to the public. We will also allow consumers to get a preivew of the graphs that they can create with the data. The graphs will be sufficiently water marked in order to encourage consumers to pay for the non water marked version. Doing this will allow the consumer to see what the graphs that we produce look like and hopefully interest them in purchasing a non watermarked version.

###Paid for 
We will offer consumers the ability to pay in order to download querried data or to download non watermarked graphs. I believe the graphs will be the real selling point for consumers paying for our service. Users can very easily create graphs over a specified range of dates and have graphs within seconds. This ease of access is something that users would be willing to pay for if this data in a graphical format is useful to them.
